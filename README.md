# Tool Integrations

The example scripts that were previously in this project (`computer-use.ts`, `file-search.ts`, etc.) were designed for a Node.js environment and are not compatible with this live browser-based sandbox. They have been disabled to allow the application to run correctly.

The core application uses the Gemini API for code generation and the OpenAI API for web search functionality, which are configured to work within the browser.
